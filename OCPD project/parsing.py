everyone Ken here, I have been told that due to the extent of my lung disease COPD hay LVR and Transplants are not possible.', 'With LVR can they just remove small areas of the diseased lung through bronchoscope procedures in order to better facilitate a healthier portion of the lung to expand and work more proficiently.', 'I understand that removing partitions of the lung that traps co2 air that can not be exhaled could be relieved very slowly like the squeezing of the neck of a inflated ballon with out the risk of pneumothorax and even if it did occur there are powders and sealants that can be used to stop the air leaks.', 'I’m', 'I nuts or just to far advanced in medicine theory.', 'Thank for the responses.', 'KenI have COPD and I am very interested in participating in any helpful

'Please help me if you can.', 'I am a resident of Florida, however possibly could relocate to a study area  , such as NC if needed.', 'Ken I live in Wisconsin and have seen several doctors on LVR and lung transplants.', 'The LVR can be done when emphysema has created large areas of damage.', 'Then they can take and cut out a portion of the lungs.', 'This then allows the good section of the lung to expand to it', '’s full potential.', 'With the damaged portion in there air is trapped in the areas with emphysema which creates an over inflation of the lungs.', 'So when you try to breath the good portion cannot expand fully.', 'I was told that the damage to my lungs is kind of spread through out so the LVR is not an option for me.', 'I was told they generally look for large areas of damage in the upper lobes and then remove the upper lobes of the lungs.', 'As far as transplants go I think you would have to be really bad for them not to be able to do one.', 'Of course there are many other things that could prevent it also.', 'When they do the evaluation for a lung transplant they pretty much check every part of your body to make sure all systems are working properly.', 'Your heart, bone density, dental, sinus scan, ct scan, colonoscopy and many other tests.', 'If any of those are not up to par then they probably will not do it.', 'I just talked to woman though', 'that had one done at Jewish Barnes Hospital.', 'Her pulmonary function test before the surgery was 16% of predicted.', 'Her son had to carry her oxygen bottle when she walked', 'so she was pretty bad.', 'However she said they had her do a walk on the treadmill and said she needed to be able to walk for 30 minutes.', 'It did not matter at what speed or how much oxygen she needed just needed to complete the 30 minutes.', 'I don’t', 'know how bad you are', 'but if you are close to what she was or even a little bit worse it still may be possible.', 'I would check with different hospitals that do lung transplants and see.', 'A second opinion is always good.', 'I went to UW Health in Madison WI and was seen by one of there pulmonologists for an initial evaluation.', 'That is when my PFT came back at 16% and they were willing to do the rest of the evaluation', 'so apparently I was not too bad for them to continue.', 'I was reluctant to do it because I don’t like the survival rates', 'and you can’t', 'just get approved for the list and then turn them down if a lung becomes available or they will probably take you off the list.', 'Also once they do the full evaluation they like to put you on the list right away because if you wait they may have to do some of the tests again.', 'My suggestion is that if you are sure you would like to do a transplant then check around and see what different places say.', 'You could even call Jewish Barnes Hospital.', 'That lady that I talked to said she went there because she read that they were one of the best and did a lot of lung transplants.', 'After 6 months she is doing great and her last PFT was 108%.', 'I hope this info helps you and I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers.', 'If you want you can call me', '920 527
